# discord-build-bot
A build bot for Discordâ„¢ builds that uses https://gh.adi.wtf/api and https://gh.adi.wtf/dfetch to get data.

## Usage
You can invite the bot using this link here: https://adi.wtf/invite/b2d9a

The invite link will give permissions that are needed to operate, notably Manage Roles so it can toggle mention permissions for certain roles.

Once you've invited the bot into your server, a few steps left, run the configure command to get the bot configured quickly.

``~configure <channel_id> <role_to_ping>``, in the case you want it to post messages without pinging anyone, you can enter ``-1`` for the roles to ping.

## Contribution
You are free to make pull requests, please ensure you use Python 3.6 for all testing using Discord.py async, not Discord.py rewrite.
